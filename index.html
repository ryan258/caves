				<h2>Bring your Event Underground at the</h2>
				<p><img src="http://www.wabashastreetcaves.com/images/Front_of_Caves-Fall.jpg" width="201" height="264"></p>
				<p>The Wabasha Street Caves is the most unique facility for private events in the Twin Cities. Located along the Mississippi River in downtown St. Paul, The Wabasha Street Caves offers a fascinating and mysterious setting for your next gathering event. The Caves 12,000 square feet of space is tastefully finished with brick walls, stucco ceilings, carpeted dining space and beautiful tile floors in the cocktail area. There is a theatrical stage, large hardwood dance floor, plenty of dining and meeting space, and a handsome 60 foot bar. Since the Caves are underground, geothermal energy is used to help limit the fuel needed for heating and we can conserve energy without the use of air conditioning. This is our part of going GREEN!</p>

				<h2>Conventions</h2>

				<p>Why have all work and no play? Along with your Convention agenda, you may want to take people off-site for a private dinner, play, dance, casino, murder mystery, or theme party. Why not bring them to The Wabasha Street Caves to enjoy the most unusual setting between New York and San Francisco.</p>

				<h2>Special Events &amp; Murder Mysteries</h2>

				<p>Group and private parties such as wedding receptions, class reunions, fund raisers, birthdays, anniversaries, and corporate parties have found The Wabasha Street Caves to be the perfect place for a unique and unforgettable party. For private groups, we offer our own Murder Mystery called "Tommy Gun Trouble" which reenacts a murder in the Caves. It is a fun and interactive show done with 7 improv actors who play with your audience during the show. We also have a 3 Person Improv Show that is a great add-on to any party. Give us a call for details.</p>

				<p>Testimonials:</p>

				<p>We wanted to express our gratitude for a fantastic evening Saturday night. Our team had a wonderful time. Today, we have continued to hear from teammates that the venue was fun and unique, the show was an absolute riot
				and it was the best company party we have had (this coming from some of our
				longtime employees!). The actors did a fantastic job of working in a <u>ton</u>
				of personalized information for our team and did it in such a smooth way that at
				first some people didn’t even realize it was happening!<o:p>
				&nbsp;Thank you for your suggestions and help in pulling it all together. Please
				share our appreciation with the actors/bar staff and others that helped!

				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF">I
				just wanted to tell you how awesome and incredible the event turned out.&nbsp;
				Your staff was great and really helped make the event a success.&nbsp; We
				couldn’t have asked for a better tour guide.&nbsp; Kitty Kelly was a hit and
				people are still talking about her.&nbsp; The way she moved through the crowd,
				interacted, and inspired people to participate was incredible.&nbsp; The bar
				staff (Laura and Geno) were so accommodating and fun that it felt like they were
				part of the family.&nbsp; We’ve
				also reached out to Greg and Grace to help with dance lessons who were also so
				accommodating and wonderful to work with.&nbsp; I
				just can’t say enough about how impressed I am with you and your staff and how
				appreciative I am with all everyone did to make my daughters event such a
				success. " ~&nb

				<p>"Dear Anne, Ryan, and Cave staff,&nbsp; Now that things have calmed
				down, we wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you did to make our
				April 9th wedding memorable.&nbsp; We could not be happier with our decision to
				tie the knot in the Caves.&nbsp; We had a blast, and so did our guests.&nbsp;
				Anne was wonderful to work with, and her attention to detail and flexibility
				helped us to have the best event possible.&nbsp; Ryan was amazing as Baby Face
				Nelson - our guests were completely wooed by him, and we are still hearing from
				them how much fun they had on his tour!&nbsp; The bartenders were also attentive
				and personable, and helped create that festive vibe we loved.&nbsp; Thank you
				for many memories!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best~&nbsp; Derek &amp; Linda"

				<p>"Our wedding was absolutely amazing! We couldn't
				believe how gorgeous everything looked in the Caves. Thanks a million to
				your staff for the wonderful reception. :-)" Kara ~ Wedding October,
				2009</p>

				<p>"I just wanted to let you know
				that the party was absolutely amazing.&nbsp; I would like to especially thank
				you, the coat check (so NICE! And helpful), gangsters (the tours were a
				highlight.&nbsp; I was shocked at how many people just loved them -&nbsp; the
				adults were crazy for them and the kids seemed….well just a bit crazy!&nbsp; Bartenders
				– who were quite the entertainers and got everyone “happy” –&nbsp; they
				were fabulous!<o:p>
				&nbsp;The Cave was “warm” and welcoming and no one was cold – just as you
				promised.<o:p>
				&nbsp;I would love to serve as a reference for you or the caves at any point in
				the future.&nbsp; I think it is the best place to have a great party!<o:p>
				&nbsp; You coordinated everyone beautifully and I believe our expectations were
				exceeded in every category!"
