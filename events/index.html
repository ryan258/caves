					<p>The Wabasha Street Caves is the most unique facility for private events in the Twin Cities. Located along the Mississippi River in downtown St. Paul, The Wabasha Street Caves offers a fascinating and mysterious setting for your next gathering event. The Caves 12,000 square feet of space is tastefully finished with brick walls, stucco ceilings, carpeted dining space and beautiful tile floors in the cocktail area. There is a theatrical stage, large hardwood dance floor, plenty of dining and meeting space, and a handsome 60 foot bar. Since the Caves are underground, geothermal energy is used to help limit the fuel needed for heating and we can conserve energy without the use of air conditioning. This is our part of going GREEN!</p>

				<h2>Testimonials:</h2>

				<p>We wanted to express our gratitude for a fantastic evening Saturday night. Our team had a wonderful time. Today, we have continued to hear from teammates that the venue was fun and unique, the show was an absolute riot and it was the best company party we have had (this coming from some of our longtime employees!). The actors did a fantastic job of working in a ton of personalized information for our team and did it in such a smooth way that at first some people didn’t even realize it was happening! Thank you for your suggestions and help in pulling it all together. Please share our appreciation with the actors/bar staff and others that helped!</p>

				<p>Rob ~ Corporate Event February, 2015</p>

				<p>I just wanted to tell you how awesome and incredible the event turned out. Your staff was great and really helped make the event a success. We couldn’t have asked for a better tour guide. Kitty Kelly was a hit and people are still talking about her. The way she moved through the crowd, interacted, and inspired people to participate was incredible. The bar staff (Laura and Geno) were so accommodating and fun that it felt like they were part of the family. We’ve also reached out to Greg and Grace to help with dance lessons who were also so accommodating and wonderful to work with. I just can’t say enough about how impressed I am with you and your staff and how appreciative I am with all everyone did to make my daughters event such a success."</p>

				<p>Lori A. Deshler ~ Wedding July, 2011</p>

				<p>"Dear Anne, Ryan, and Cave staff, Now that things have calmed down, we wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you did to make our April 9th wedding memorable. We could not be happier with our decision to tie the knot in the Caves. We had a blast, and so did our guests. Anne was wonderful to work with, and her attention to detail and flexibility helped us to have the best event possible. Ryan was amazing as Baby Face Nelson - our guests were completely wooed by him, and we are still hearing from them how much fun they had on his tour! The bartenders were also attentive and personable, and helped create that festive vibe we loved.Thank you for many memories! Best</p>

				<p>Derek &amp; Linda" ~ Wedding 2011</p>

				<p>"Our wedding was absolutely amazing! We couldn't believe how gorgeous everything looked in the Caves. Thanks a million to your staff for the wonderful reception. :-)"</p>

				<p>Kara ~ Wedding October, 2009</p>

				<p>"I just wanted to let you know that the party was absolutely amazing. I would like to especially thank you, the coat check (so NICE! And helpful), gangsters (the tours were a highlight. I was shocked at how many people just loved them - the adults were crazy for them and the kids seemed….well just a bit crazy Bartenders – who were quite the entertainers and got everyone “happy” – they were fabulous! The Cave was “warm” and welcoming and no one was cold – just as you promised. I would love to serve as a reference for you or the caves at any point in the future. I think it is the best place to have a great party! You coordinated everyone beautifully and I believe our expectations were exceeded in every category!"</p>
